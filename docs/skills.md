# Skills

This project currently does not define custom local skills.

If skills are added later, document them here with:
- Name
- Description
- Where to read the skill file
- When to use it

## Engineering Requirements
- For each implementation step: add tests covering the new feature, run tests, and fix failures before moving to the next step.
- Do not advance to a new step until tests pass for the current step.
